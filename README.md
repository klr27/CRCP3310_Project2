# Data: Narrative, Meaning, and Discovery
## Project 2: Data Structure Safari & Adventures in Algorithms
Create an animated visualization of as many data structures as you can, illustrating insertion and deletion operations, and algorithms for search.

### Requirements
1. The visualization should have two main parts: the story, and the state. The “story” portion illustrates each data structure as they move through two dimensional space. The “state” portion illustrates the internal state of each structure’s data.

2. Story Requirements:
* Each data structure should be represented abstractly, and initially appear near one side of the window.
* The landscape of the story should model and display numerous nodes of color – the data.
* As the program runs, each data structure should move toward the opposite side of the window (e.g. from the left side to the right side)
* The landscape should be divided into 3 or 4 “add” and “delete” zones. When a structure is in the “add” zone and touches a node, that node should be added to the structure. When a structure is in the “delete” zone and touches a node, that node should be deleted from the structure, if that data exists in the structure.
3. State Requirements:
* Each data structure should be illustrated on the screen.
* Each illustration of a data structure should allude to the qualities of that structure. For example, a Bag’s data looks different than a Stack’s data.
* Every time a node is added or deleted from a structure, the illustration of that structure’s state should reflect this change.
